Looking to build framework for trustless conditional contracts using ether to empower momentum-gathering initiatives in otherwise disempowered corners of the world.

as a starter

I am personally not a coder, but looking to acquire a basic understanding for handling ethereum.
I have experience and or interest in travelbusiness, webshops, start-ups, information architecture, philosophy, politics, ethics, magic and sacred geometry.
Codewise i can just hack a bit of html, css and php (and gwbasic and EASYamos if anybody remembers that;-)

Anyone interested feel welcome to PM

Anyone who can share UI modules that may help build above mindmapped app, may earn a reward.

Peace.
