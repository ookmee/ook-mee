# ook-mee
Looking to build dapp using stellar (or any lean and mean organically growing ledger that doesn't require ridiculous amounts of proof of work like btc) to empower momentum-gathering initiatives in otherwise disempowered corners of the world.
Momentum can be described economically or democratically. I.e. pledge or vote.
Example template for economical user interaction can be found on
https://atlas.mindmup.com/2015/04/2d8fc520cfcd0132234a4e9e8be13658/ookmee_com/index.html
as a starter.

I am personally not a coder, but looking to acquire a basic understanding of the modules handling Stellar or similar DCP.
I have experience and or interest in travelbusiness, webshops, start-ups, information architecture, philosophy, politics, ethics, magic and sacred geometry and sailing, mostly sailing.
Codewise, i can just hack a bit of html, css and php.

Anyone interested feel welcome to PM

Anyone who can share UI modules that may help build above mindmapped app, may earn a reward.

Peace.
